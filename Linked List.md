1. Linked List vs Array (Why use Linked List?)
   
   1. Access
      
      1. Array O(1) - better
      
      2. Linked List: O(n)
   
   2. Insert/Delete at beginning
      
      1. Array O(n)
      
      2. Linked List O(1) - better
   
   3. Insert/Delete at end
      
      1. Array O(1) 
      
      2. Linked List O(1)
   
   4. Insert/Delete at middle
      
      1. Array O(n)
      
      2. Linked List O(n)
   
   5. Searching for an element
      
      1. Array O(n)
      
      2. Linked List O(n)

2. If your application requires more frequent insertions and deletions, especially at the beginning or middle of the collection, linked lists might be a better choice. For cases where you need fast random access or frequently perform operations at the end of the collection, arrays could be more suitable.
